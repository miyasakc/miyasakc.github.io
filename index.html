  <h4> About </h4>
  <p>
  I am a Computer Science major taking an applied option in Simulation and Game Programming at Oregon State University.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of this project is to create a handheld augmented reality device that will take in a video through a Raspberry Pi Camera Module and find ArUco Markers within the visual input </br>
    of the device. Then the Raspberry Pi will be able to recognize the ArUco Marker and project relevent data back onto the surrounding surfaces. Due to the large scope of this project, </br>
    the majority of the project is focused on using homography to orient the position of the device relative to the ArUco Markers. An example of this device in use would be in a construction </br>
    site would exist a ArUco Marker that will be able to be scanned and recognized through functions from the OpenCV library. The device would then call on relevent information </br>
    that will be projected back onto the surroundings of the ArUco Marker. For example, it would tell the position of a wall or a pipe based on the blueprints of the building </br>
    associated with the ArUco Marker.

  <h4> Project Work </h4>
  <p>
    On the project, I've completed the objectives that we all set for ourselves as a team which was setting up the hardware needed <br>for our
    project, which would be the Raspberry Pi 4 and its associated camera module. We also needed to make sure to download <br>OpenCV onto the
    Raspberry Pi. While I've done that, I've also mainly been in charge of the paperwork portion of our work, <br>formatting our papers, 
    preparing materials for our presentation and writing assignments. I've also done some research into homography and how it relates to our project.
