  <h4> About </h4>
  <p>
  I am a Computer Science major taking an applied option in Simulation and Game Programming at Oregon State University.
  </p>
  <h4> Project Work </h4>
  <p>
    On the project, I've completed the objectives that we all set for ourselves as a team which was setting up the hardware needed <br>for our
    project, which would be the Raspberry Pi 4 and its associated camera module. We also needed to make sure to download <br>OpenCV onto the
    Raspberry Pi. While I've done that, I've also mainly been in charge of the paperwork portion of our work, <br>formatting our papers, 
    preparing materials for our presentation and writing assignments.
