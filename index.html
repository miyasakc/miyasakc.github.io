  <h4> About </h4>
  <p>
  I am a Computer Science major taking an applied option in Simulation and Game Programming at Oregon State University.

  <h4> Project Work </h4>
  <p>
    On the project, I've completed the objectives that we all set for ourselves as a team which was setting up the hardware needed for our
    project, which would be the Raspberry Pi 4 and its associated camera module. We also needed to make sure to download OpenCV onto the
    Raspberry Pi. While I've done that, I've also mainly been in charge of the paperwork portion of our work, formatting our papers, 
    preparing materials for our presentation and writing assignments.
